            app development, where I transform ideas into innovative mobile
            experiences. Whether its Android or iOS, I have a solid
            understanding of native development, and Im comfortable working
            with languages like Kotlin. Im also skilled in cross-platform
            development using frameworks such as React Native . <br />

            working on end-to-end projects, tackling challenges at every layer
            of the technology stack. From creating server-side APIs using
            frameworks like Node.js and Django, to managing databases such as
            MySQL and MongoDB, I can handle it all.
